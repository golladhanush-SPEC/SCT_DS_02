# Titanic Dataset - Data Cleaning & Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)


📌 Project Overview

This project involves performing data cleaning and exploratory data analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset from Kaggle.
The goal is to explore relationships between variables, identify patterns, and analyze trends in passenger survival.

📂 Files in Repository

titanic_eda.ipynb → Jupyter Notebook containing all data cleaning and EDA steps.

train.csv → Original Titanic dataset file.

🛠️ Steps Performed

1. Data Cleaning

Handled missing values in Age, Cabin, and Embarked.

Converted categorical variables to numerical values where needed.

Removed irrelevant columns for analysis.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis

Summary statistics and data distribution visualization.

Survival rate analysis by gender, class, and age group.

Correlation heatmap to understand relationships between features.

Visualization of fare distribution and its relationship with survival.

📊 Key Observations

Sex: Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate.

Pclass: Passengers in 1st class had a much higher chance of survival than those in 3rd class.

Fare: Higher fares were generally associated with higher survival rates.

Age: Younger passengers, especially children, had better survival chances.

Family Size: Moderate family size (SibSp + Parch) improved survival odds.

🚀 How to Run

1. Download or clone this repository:

git clone https://github.com/golladhanush-SPEC/SCT_DS_02.git


2. Open titanic_eda.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook.
